I made a few changes to the LocationLog concept from the Assignment 2 version. 

1. I renamed the concept to "LocationLog", since that makes it more clear what its purpose is without needing 2 names (LocationLog and LocationLogging).
2. I made the generic type for location Space instead of Location, since my concept for storage spaces is named Space and this makes it more clear.

There were no issues when implementing and testing this concept as well.
